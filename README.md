# Hubbard_GW
## Description:
Hubbard_GW is a scientific code for solving the single-band Hubbard model in graphene nanosystems or linear chains, using the diagrammatic GW approximation.

## Features:
It allows for:
* computing mean-field (MF) approximation
* computing GW and G0W0 approximations
* computing Green's function, (local) density of states, local magnetic moments
* computing optical absorption cross section using non-interacting Green's functions or random-phase approximation (RPA)
* computing the Generalized Plasmonic Index (GPI)

## Requirements
This code was developed and tested using:
* python v3.6.6
* pybinding v0.9.4
* numpy >= v1.12
* scipy >= v0.19

## How to use the code: 

* clone the repository in your local environement and make sure you get all required packages installed (see requirements)

* specify input parameters in the input.py file

* specify the nanographene system in the TB_Hubbard_input.py file, using the Pybinding package  
    
* run the TB_Hubbard_input.py file
