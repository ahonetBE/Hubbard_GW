# Hubbard_GW
Scientifique code for computing mean-field and GW approximations of single-band Hubbard model as well as optical absorption cross section.

How to cite:

Requirements: numpy, scipy, pybinding, ...

To use the code: 

    - specify input parameters in the input.py file

    - specify the system in the TB_Hubbard_input.py file, using the Pybinding package  
    
    - run the TB_Hubbard_input.py file

Input parameters guide (in the input.txt file) :

    - each line starting with a single "#" sign specifies the name of input variable to be entered the following line

    - each line starting directly with a number specify the value of the variable named the line before

    - each line starting with three "#" signs are ignored by the code
